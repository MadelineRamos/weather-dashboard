This application is a weather dashboard. It works when a user inputs a city in which they would like to see todays weather as well as a 5 day forecast. Once the user hits the search button, that days weather is displayed as well as a 5 day forecast of the upcoming days. After the user searches a city, that city is then added to a list below the search button. This will house any city's that the user searches so they have a quick and easy access to previous city searches.
